# How to Play the Game


Are you old enough to remember the game Frogger? If you were not around in the 1980's , probably not. This arcade game is a cute rendition of the old game Frogger. Like Frogger as your player was a frog trying to cross a busy highway without getting smashed by cars; with this game, you are a beautiful princess trying to make your way across the board to safety. That's without colliding with some nasty bugs (your enemies)!

To play the game locally:
1. Clone this repository by clicking the green "Clone or download" button via GitHub Desktop or Download ZIP
2. Open the .html file in your browser

You will:
  - Use your arrow keys on your keyboard to move around the board:
  -     Up arrow to step forward
  -     Down arrow for jump backwards
  -     Left arrow to move to the left
  -     Right arrow to move to the right
You have to make it across to the top without colliding with the bugs. The bugs are your enemies; avoid them as your life depends on it :)

  - If you collide with the bugs before making it across; you have to start over. The game resets to your original position on the board.

# When you win the game, you get a pop-up

Once you made it across the board without a collision, you've won the game. You will then get a pop-up congratulating you on your success.

You get to try again by pressing the Play Again button.
